## Mjollnircoin


### Technical specification

 - Algorithm: Multicrypt
 - Max Coins: 42 million mjollnircoins (42,000,000)
 - Block time: 2.5 minutes
 - Block retarget up: Every 10 blocks (max 100%)
 - Block retarget down: Every block (max 500%)
 - Block reward: 50 coins per block 
 - Multipool defense: Temporal retargeting
 - Block halving: Every 420K blocks (~2 years)
 
 
### Temporal retargeting
In order to withstand the difficulty fluctuations that would occur when automatic profit switching mining pools (multipools) hits Mjollnircoin, Mjollnir will begin to self-heal the network by lowering the difficulty if no block is found after a significant amount of time; The network will automatically recover from a multipool difficulty spike without emergency developer intervention within ~3 hours.
