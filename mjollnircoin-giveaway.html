<h2>What is Bittrex?</h2>
<p>
Built and operated in the United States, Bittrex is the next generation crypto trading platform created by security professionals. They are crypto-coin enthusiasts bringing more than 50 years of combined security and development experience to the trading community from companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Qualys, and BlackBerry.
</p>
<p>
Given the recent security breaches and reliability issues experienced by other markets,they felt the community deserved better. If virtual currencies are to truly take off, trustworthy infrastructure is a prerequisite.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<h2>What makes Bittrex different?</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Secure platform</b><p>We know that <a href="https://twitter.com/ramikawach/status/478299752073687041/photo/1">security</a> makes the difference and to that end Bittrex employs the most reliable security technologies available. As part of this approach, we leverage an elastic multi-stage wallet strategy ensuring that 80-90% of funds are offline and safe. Additionally, two-factor authentication is required for all withdrawals and API usage. At Bittrex, security will always be a key factor that impacts every development decision we make.</p></li>
<li><b>Custom built trading engine</b><p>Our custom trading engine was designed to be scalable using elastic computing. The Bittrex platform processes and executes orders as soon as they are placed so you will never see a crossed order book or delay in processing of any trades.</p></li>
<li><b>Fast deposits and withdrawals</b><p>Our highly efficient and automated monitoring platform allows us to give you the fastest transactions available today. This includes updates on balance, trade, and wallet information. You will never be left wondering where your funds are or if your deposits are blocked, as information is always up to date.</p></li>
<li><b>Complete and easy REST API</b><p>Our full featured set of APIs allows you to withdraw as easily as you deposit, as well as trade, and exchange. Bittrex was built with high frequency trading in mind. We have designed the most complete API set for developers to build on our platform.</p>
