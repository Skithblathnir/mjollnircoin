<h2>
Initial Public Coin Offering
</h2>
<p>
Mjollnircoin has an IPCO in which {{page.mnr_total}} ({{page.mnr_totalp}}) of all coins will be distributed upon launch to early investors.
This will ensure that Mjollnircoin receives initial value from the start as well as providing funds for continued development and marketing.
The funds will be released in 3 phases, 30 , 45 and 60 days after the coin launch, on the condition that the developers are actively maintaining, supporting and developing the coin.
Investments must be received before {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}.
Mjollnir's IPCO stage will last {{page.mnr_ipco_days}} days, from {{page.mnr_ipco_start}} to {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}

<h4>IPCO stage has ended on  {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}</h4>
