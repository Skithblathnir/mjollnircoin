<h2>
Initial Public Coin Offering
</h2>
<p>
Mjollnircoin has an IPCO in which {{page.mnr_total}} ({{page.mnr_totalp}}) of all coins will be distributed upon launch to early investors.
This will ensure that Mjollnircoin receives initial value from the start as well as providing funds for continued development and marketing.
The funds will be released after the launch and after all the investors have received their share. Investments must be received before {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}.

Mjollnir's IPCO stage will last {{page.mnr_ipco_days}} days, from {{page.mnr_ipco_start}} to {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}
</p>
<h3>Dates and Information</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>IPO dates: {{page.mnr_ipco_start}} - {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}</li>
		<li>Mining Launch: {{page.mnr_ipco_mining_launch}} </li>
		<li>Wallets: Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu and source code available at launch</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>IPO details</h3>
<p>
The {{page.mnr_total}} MNR will be distributed among the IPO investors proportional to how much BTC they have invested. 
There is no limit on the amount of BTC investment. The market will determine MNR exchange rate. 
Mjollnircoin IPO investors will be paid their MNR stakes instantly at the moment the MNR wallet is released on {{page.mnr_ipco_mining_launch}}, as soon as the network is launched and the mining starts.
All investments are final and not refundable. Investments must be received before {{page.mnr_ipco_end}}. Funds received after this time will be returned to sender, with the possible loss of Bitcoin transaction fees.
